# 🚀 Corporate Commitment Monitor

A full-stack web application that tracks sustainability commitments made by companies and monitors real-world progress using AI-based classification of news updates.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

The **Corporate Commitment Monitor** helps track whether companies actually follow through on their public promises (like sustainability goals, emissions reduction, recycling targets, etc.).

The system collects company commitments and analyzes news updates to classify them as:

* ✅ Progress
* ⚠️ Delay
* ❌ Reversal
* 🔍 Unrelated

This helps increase transparency and accountability.

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Many companies publicly announce sustainability goals but fail to meet deadlines or quietly change commitments.

This project solves that by:

* Monitoring commitments
* Tracking updates from news sources
* Automatically classifying progress using AI

---

### Frontend

* React (Vite)
* CSS (Modern UI)

## 🧠 How AI Classification Works

### Input Example

Company: Britannia
Commitment: "57% renewable electricity by FY2025-26"
News: "Britannia achieved 45% renewable energy in FY2024"

### Output

```
{
  "label": "Progress",
  "confidence": 0.91,
  "reason": "Company is moving toward its target"
}
```

## 📊 Example Data

### Companies & Commitments

| Company       | Commitment                | Deadline  |
| ------------- | ------------------------- | --------- |
| Britannia     | 57% renewable electricity | FY2025-26 |
| Nestlé India  | 50% emissions reduction   | 2030      |
| Tata Consumer | 100% recyclable packaging | 2030      |

## 🔄 Workflow

1. Add company + commitment
2. Add news article
3. AI analyzes news
4. Classification stored in database
5. Dashboard updates automatically

## 🚨 Alert Rules

* 🔴 Delay or Reversal → High priority alert
* 🟡 Near deadline → Reminder
* 🟢 Progress → Logged only

## 🚀 Deployment (cloud)

You need **two** public URLs in production: the **API** (Express) and the **frontend** (static Vite build). **MongoDB Atlas** must allow connections from the internet (`Network Access` → `0.0.0.0/0` for a demo, or your host’s egress IPs).

### 1. Deploy the API (example: [Render](https://render.com))

1. Push this repo to GitHub/GitLab.
2. New **Web Service** → connect the repo.
3. Settings:
   - **Root directory:** `backend`
   - **Build command:** `npm install`
   - **Start command:** `npm start`
   - **Instance type:** Free (cold starts are normal).
4. **Environment variables** (service → Environment):

   | Key | Value |
   |-----|--------|
   | `MONGODB_URI` | Your Atlas connection string |
   | `HUGGINGFACE_API_TOKEN` | Optional; HF inference for classification |
   | `OPENAI_API_KEY` | Optional fallback |
   | `PORT` | Leave unset — Render injects `PORT` |

5. **Before the first deploy works:** open your service → **Environment** → **Add environment variable**:
   - **Key:** `MONGODB_URI`
   - **Value:** your full Atlas connection string (`mongodb+srv://user:pass@cluster.../dbname?...`)
   - Use the same string you have in local `backend/.env`. No quotes needed in Render.
   - Save, then **Manual Deploy → Deploy latest commit** (or push again). If the service started without this key, it will exit with `MONGODB_URI is not set` until you add it.
6. Deploy. Copy the service URL, e.g. `https://corporate-commitment-monitor-api.onrender.com`.
7. Test: `https://YOUR-API.onrender.com/api/health` → `"mongo": "connected"`.
8. Optional: in Render **Shell**, run `node scripts/seedIndianFoodPdf.js` from `backend` to seed demo data (requires `MONGODB_URI` in that environment).

You can also use the repo **`render.yaml`** as a [Blueprint](https://render.com/docs/blueprint-spec) and then add secrets in the dashboard.

### 2. Deploy the frontend (example: [Netlify](https://netlify.com) or [Vercel](https://vercel.com))

1. New site from repo (or drag-and-drop `frontend/dist` after a local build).
2. **Base directory:** `frontend`
3. **Build command:** `npm run build`
4. **Publish directory:** `frontend/dist` (or `dist` if base is `frontend`).
5. **Environment variable:**

   ```env
   VITE_API_URL=https://YOUR-API.onrender.com
   ```

   No trailing slash. Rebuild after changing it.

6. **SPA routing:** this repo includes `frontend/netlify.toml` (Netlify) and `frontend/vercel.json` (Vercel) so React Router paths refresh correctly.

7. Open your Netlify/Vercel URL and use the app. If the UI cannot reach the API, check browser **DevTools → Network** (CORS): the API uses open `cors()` so cross-origin requests from your frontend origin are allowed.

### 3. Local production smoke test

```bash
cd backend && npm install && npm start
cd ../frontend && npm install && npm run build && npx vite preview
```

Set `frontend/.env.production` with `VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:5000` for a local API check (Vite loads `.env.production` for `vite build`).

### 4. GitHub Pages (automated frontend)

After the API is live, the workflow **builds** the Vite app and **pushes** the `frontend/dist` output to a **`gh-pages`** branch (no “GitHub Actions” Pages source required).

1. Repo **Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions** → secret **`VITE_API_URL`** = your API URL (no trailing slash), e.g. `https://corporate-commitment-monitor.onrender.com`.
2. Repo **Settings → Pages → Build and deployment → Source:** **Deploy from a branch**.
3. **Branch:** **`gh-pages`**, **folder:** **`/`** (root). Save.
4. Push to **`main`** or **Actions → Deploy frontend to GitHub Pages → Run workflow**. The first run creates the `gh-pages` branch; refresh **Settings → Pages** if the branch is not listed until after one successful run.
5. Open **`https://<user>.github.io/<repo>/`** (example: `https://sreddy08840.github.io/Corporate-Commitment-Monitor/`).

If you previously chose **Source: GitHub Actions** and saw deploy **404** errors, switch Pages to **Deploy from branch → gh-pages** as above and use this workflow.

**Backend in production:** use Render/Railway, or build the **`backend/Dockerfile`** on any container host. Set `MONGODB_URI` and optional HF/OpenAI keys.
